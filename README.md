# ✈️ Airline Demand Forecasting  
**Time Series Forecasting | Statistical Models | Machine Learning | Streamlit**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end time-series forecasting workflow** using historical airline passenger data.  
The goal is to forecast future passenger demand, compare multiple forecasting approaches, select the most reliable model, and present results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The project focuses on:
- correct handling of time-series data  
- realistic, time-aware model evaluation  
- clear model selection decisions  
- communication of forecast uncertainty  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Accurate passenger demand forecasting is essential for:
- capacity planning  
- staffing decisions  
- budgeting and risk management  

This project answers:
- Which forecasting model performs best on unseen future data?  
- How confident can we be in the predictions?

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset used is a **publicly available airline passenger time-series dataset**, commonly used as a benchmark in forecasting problems.

**Key characteristics:**
- Monthly data from **1949 to 1960**
- Target variable: **number of airline passengers**
- Clear **long-term growth** and **yearly seasonality**

This dataset is well suited for comparing baseline, statistical, and machine learning forecasting approaches.

---

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

### Baseline Models
- Naive Forecast  
- Seasonal Naive Forecast  

Used as benchmarks to validate whether advanced models provide meaningful improvement.

### Statistical Models
- **ETS (Holt-Winters)** – explicitly models trend and yearly seasonality  
- **ARIMA** – classical time-series model used for comparison  

### Machine Learning Model
- **XGBoost**
- Uses **lag-based features** to transform the time series into a supervised learning problem  

---

## 📈 Evaluation Strategy
- **Walk-forward validation** (time-series equivalent of cross-validation)
- Preserves temporal order and avoids future data leakage
- Mimics real-world forecasting scenarios

**Metrics used:**
- RMSE  
- MAE  
- MAPE  

---

## ✅ Model Selection
All models were evaluated using the same walk-forward framework.

- **ETS (Holt-Winters)** achieved the lowest average forecast error  
- Selected as the **final production forecast**  
- Other models retained for comparison and monitoring  

---

## 📉 Forecast Uncertainty
Forecasting is inherently uncertain.  
To address this, **confidence intervals** were added to the final forecast:

- Final Forecast → best estimate  
- Lower Bound → pessimistic scenario  
- Upper Bound → optimistic scenario  

This enables planning for both expected and extreme outcomes.

---

## 🖥️ Deployment
An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** was built to:
- visualize historical passenger trends  
- compare forecasts from multiple models  
- present the selected final forecast  
- display confidence intervals  
- export forecast results as a CSV
